    "text": "Course Assessment\nThe assessment for this course consists of four major components, namely:\n\nIn-class Hands-on exercise and class participation,\nDataViz Makeover\nTake-home exercises,\nVisual Analytics Project.\n\nThere will be no mid-term test or final examination for this course.\n\nIn-class Exercise and Class Participation\nA strict requirement for each class meeting is to complete the assigned readings and to try out the hands-on exercises before coming to class. Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of hands-on exercises using either Tableau or R. In general, these exercises are guided if Tableau is used. For R programming session, hands-on guides will be shared on RPubs before lesson starts. By the end of each lesson, students are required to upload their in-class exercise onto eLearn for reviewing. The exercises will be briefly reviewed after collection. Students will be given 10 points for correctly completing the exercise, 7-9 points for partially completed and correct work, and 0 points if absent. Up to 100 points can be accumulated during the term.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to revise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had learned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is designed to be completed within 1.5-2 hours. The exercise is not a repetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics purposes.\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students with first hand experiences on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page."

    "text": "Words of Encouragement\nFor the next 12 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy, especially come to R programming\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily."

Focus on what works, what doesn’t work, why those things don’t work, and how you made it better.
