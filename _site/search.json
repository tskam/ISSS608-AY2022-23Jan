I will post one or two data visualisation and you are required to critic, suggest ways for improvement and rework the data visualisation. Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data. I am curious to see the different approaches you all take.\nThe purpose of the makeover is to improve on the original visualisation. Focus on what works, what doesn’t work, why those things don’t work, and how you made it better. You should try stick to the fields in the data set provided and improve upon the original visualisation. However, if supplementing the data helps you tell a better story, go for it!"

At a first glance, it seems making a lot of sense. But, when we try to take a closer look at the text and graph, you will notice that there are at least two major issues, one is related to truthfulness of the data visualisation and the second one is related to its clarity aspect. For example, the x-axis is showing quarterly time interval. But, the second sentence talks about “For the first half this year, Nodx fell 4.5 per cent compared with the same period last year.” which is not inline with what was shown on the x-axis. Furthermore, the values on the y-axis are in per cent. Hence the correct term should be percentage point instead of per cent because we are comparing the differences between two percentages.\nThis is what motivate me to design this course. This course is not about using Tableau or R to create beautiful data visualisation only. More importantly, it aims to embark you the skills of getting smarter when reading data visualisation. From today onwards, I would like to encourage you to take a good look at every data visualisation you come across and carefully evaluate them not only from their aestheticness only but also their clarity."

The line graph on the slide is a good example. This is a trade balance line graph prepared by William Playfair in 1786. You probably have identify this chart as a common line graph. The horizontal axis is years, the vertical axis measures the volume of imports and export. When you take a good look at the graph, you will be very impressed by conscious effort given by the author to shade the space between the import and export lines. When the trade balance was against England, the area was shared in red and when the trade balance was in favour of England, the area was shaded in brown. With the advancement of graph drawing tools, sadly to say, we hardly see this carefully crafted line graph been used."

Many of us know Florence as The Mother of Nursing, but she was also a statistician, and reformer. If we look at the rose diagram, we can see that the area of each coloured wedge, measured from the centre, is in proportion to the statistic it represents. The blue outer wedges represent the deaths from contagious diseases, such as cholera and typhus. The central red wedges show the deaths from wounds. The black wedges in between represent deaths from all other causes. If this rate had continued, and troops had not been replaced frequently, then disease alone would have killed the entire British Army in the Crimea. Nightingale’s graph not only dramatised the extent of the needless deaths among the soldiers during the Crimean War, but it was used as a tool to persuade Victorial government and medical profession that deaths were preventable if sanitation reforms were implemented in military and civilian hospitals."

At the first glance, it resemble the flow map but the map actually reveal more information than a common flow map. The illustration depicts Napoleon’s army departing the Polish-Russian border. A thick band illustrates the size of his army at specific geographic points during their advance and retreat. It displays six types of data in two dimensions: the number of Napoleon’s troops; the distance traveled; temperature; latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates without making mention of Napoleon; Minard’s interest lay with the travails and sacrifices of the soldiers. This type of band graph for illustration of flows was later called a Sankey diagram, although Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey (9 November 1853 – 3 October 1926) used this visualisation 30 years later and only for thematic energy flow. Interestingly, If you take a closer look at the lower center of the graph, you will notice that the term Tableau Graphique was used.\nThe important learning lesson from these four historical data visualisation is that in order to design a functional and yet enlightening data visualisation, we need to master the science and arts of data visualisation design instead of using default graphing functions of modern data visualisation toolkit. Just like writing, by knowing how to use MS Word, you will not be able to become a great editor."

The discussion consists of five sections. First, I will provide an overview of data visualisation design process. Next, by using appropriate examples, I will share with you the importance of data selection and preparation in building enlightening graphs. In section three, the principles of visual perception will be introduce. In section four, the practical guides of data visualisation design will be discussed. Lastly, a framework for evaluating and criticising data visualisation design will be introduced."

Is it to explore some data, to convey an inferential analysis, to deliver a message, convince an audience, or support a decision? It may be a mixture of these—for example, even seemingly simple exploratory plots should serve some (perhaps implicit) decision (e.g., on how to explore further). Every graph, and, more generally, every communication, must be tailored to its specific purpose."

Tufte claims that good graphical representations maximize data-ink and erase as much non-data-ink as possible. Thus, he defines the data-ink ratio is the proportion of a graphic’s ink devoted to the non-redundant display of data-information. It should equal to (1 - the proportion of graphics that can be erased without loss of data-information)."

Provides ‘geoms’ for Tufte’s box plot and range frame.\nGGally extends ‘ggplot2’ by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data. Some of these functions include a pairwise plot matrix, a two group pairwise plot matrix, a parallel coordinates plot, a survival plot, and several functions to plot networks.\nsjPlot:Data Visualization for Statistics in Social Science\nggstatsplot is an extension of ggplot2 package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the plots themselves and targeted primarily at behavioral sciences community to provide a one-line code to produce information-rich plots.\nggside allows the user to add graphical information about one of the main panel’s axis. This is particularly useful for metadata for discrete axis, or summary graphics on a continuous axis such as a boxplot or a density distribution. These vignette and article provide useful introduction.\nPatchwork is a package designed to make plot composition in R extremely simple and powerful. It is mainly intended for users of ggplot2 and goes to great lengths to make sure ggplots are properly aligned no matter the complexity of your composition. The Getting Started page explains the main features of the package.\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\nggdist is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualizing distributions and uncertainty. It is designed for both frequentist and [https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/articles/freq-uncertainty-vis.html] visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization: for frequentist models, one visualizes confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette(“freq-uncertainty-vis”)); for Bayesian models, one visualizes probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist)."

Readings will be provided from the textbook on technical information and from provided documents and articles on business applications of Visual Analytics. Students are required to review the recommended readings and class exercises before coming to class. Without preparation, the learning and discussions would not be as meaningful. Student sharing of insights from readings and hands-on exercises of assigned materials in class participation will form a large part of the learning in this course.\nDuring lesson, students are required to complete a series of hands-on exercises using either Tableau or R. In general, these exercises are guided if Tableau is used. For R programming session, hands-on guides will be shared on RPubs before lesson starts. By the end of each lesson, students are required to upload their in-class exercise onto eLearn for reviewing. The exercises will be briefly reviewed after collection. Students will be given 10 points for correctly completing the exercise, 7-9 points for partially completed and correct work, and 0 points if absent. Up to 100 points can be accumulated during the term.\n\n\nTake-home Exercise\nThe take-home exercise provides students with the opportunity to revise and practice the R packages and programming skills they had learned in class at home. It is a weekly exercise. Each exercise is designed to be completed within 1.5-2 hours. The exercise is not a repetition of the in-class exercise but it requires students to be innovative and creative in applying appropriate R packages to design enlightening and yet functional data visualisation for analytics purposes.\nStudents may work together to help one another with R programming issues and discuss the materials that constitute the take-home exercise. However, each student is required to prepare and submit the take-home exercise (including any computer work) on their own. Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating includes but not limited to: plagiarism and submission of work that is not the student’s\n\n\nVisual Analytics Project\nThe purpose of the project is to provide students with first hand experiences on collecting, processing and analysing large business data using real world data. A project may involve developing new methods or implementing visual analytics system to support analytic tasks in specific domains. Alternatively, a project may be in the form of application development by integrating analytical tools within a visual analytics environment. Students are encouraged to focus on research topics that are relevant to their field of study. It should address a concrete visual analytics problem and should propose a novel and creative solution.\nFor more details please refer to Visual Analytics Project page."

    "text": "Words of Encouragement\nFor the next 10 weeks, your learning journey will be very bumpy, especially come to R programming\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 — made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nEven experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, and don’t hesitate to approach me.\nThe students who have a bad time in this course are the ones who don’t work with one another to learn. We are a learning community, and we should help each other to learn.\nIf you understand something and someone is struggling with it, try and help them. If you are struggling, take a breath, and try to pinpoint what you are struggling with.\nOur goal is to be better programmers each day, not to be the perfect programmer. There’s no such thing as a perfect programmer. I’ve been learning new things almost every day.\nI promise you can succeed in this class as long as you are willing to learn, practice, be open minded and don’t give up easily."

First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\nDisplaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip <- c(paste0(     #<<\n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         #<<\n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) #<<\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), #<<\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nInteractivity: By hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\nCustomising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css <- \"background-color:white; #<<\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #<<\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #<<\n    opts_tooltip(    #<<\n      css = tooltip_css)) #<<\n)                                        \n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer to Customizing girafe objects to learn more about how to customise ggiraph objects.\n\n\n\nDisplaying statistics on tooltip\n\ntooltip <- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {   #<<\n  mean <- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy) #<<\n  sem <- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy) #<<\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem) #<<\n} #<<\n\ngg_point <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  #<<\n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  #<<\n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  #<<\n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\nCode chunk on the left shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below show the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             #<<\n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the default value of the hover css is hover_css = “fill:orange;”.\n\n\nStyling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        #<<\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  #<<\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") #<<\n  )                                      #<<  \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Different from Slide 9, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\nCombining tooltip and hover effect\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np <- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, #<<\n        data_id = CLASS),#<<              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.

    "text": "Visualising Large Data Interactively\nIn this hands-on exercise you will learn how to visualise large data by using packed bar methods. For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, two data sets will be used. They are:\n\nGDP.csv provides GDP, GDP per capita and GDP PPP data for world countries from 2000 to 2020. The data was extracted from World Development Indicators Database of World Bank.\nWorldCountry.csv provides a list of country names and the continent they belong to extracted from Statistics Times.\nWrite a code chunk to import both data sets by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nThe solution:\n\nGDP <- read_csv(\"data/GDP.csv\")\n\nRows: 648 Columns: 25\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (25): Country Name, Country Code, Series Name, Series Code, 2000, 2001, ...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nWorldCountry <- read_csv(\"data/WorldCountry.csv\")\n\nRows: 250 Columns: 7\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): Country or Area, ISO-alpha3 Code, Region 1, Region 2, Continent\ndbl (2): No, M49 Code\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nNote: It is always a good practice to check the data structure and examine data values in RStudio.\n\nData preparetion\nBefore programming the data visualisation, it is important for us to reshape, wrangle and transform the raw data to meet the data visualisation need.\nCode chunk below performs following tasks:\n\nmutate() of dplyr package is used to convert all values in the 202 field into numeric data type.\nselect() of dplyr package is used to extract column 1 to 3 and Values field.\npivot_wider() of tidyr package is used to split the values in Series Name field into columns.\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used to perform a left-join by using Country Code of GDP_selected and ISO-alpha3 Code of WorldCountry tibble data tables as unique identifier.\n\n\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(Values = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  select(1:3, Values) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = `Series Name`,\n              values_from = `Values`) %>%\n  left_join(y=WorldCountry, by = c(\"Country Code\" = \"ISO-alpha3 Code\"))\n\nWarning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing packed bar method\n\npacked bar is a relatively new data visualisation method introduced by Xan Gregg from JMP.\n\nIt aims to support the need of visualising skewed data over hundreds of categories.\n\nThe idea is to support the Focus+Context data visualization principle.\nVisit this JMP Blog to learn more about the design principles of packed bar.\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation\nAs usual, we need to prepare the data before building the packed bar. Prepare the data by using the code chunk below.\n\nGDP_selected <- GDP %>%\n  mutate(GDP = as.numeric(`2020`)) %>%\n  filter(`Series Name` == \"GDP (current US$)\") %>%\n  select(1:2, GDP) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nWarning in mask$eval_all_mutate(quo): NAs introduced by coercion\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above\n\nna.omit() is used to exclude rows with missing values. This is because rPackedBar package does not support missing values.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a packed bar by using rPackedBar package.\nIn the code chunk below, plotly_packed_bar() of rPackedBar package is used to create an interactive packed bar.\n\np = plotly_packed_bar(\n  input_data = GDP_selected,\n  label_column = \"Country Name\",\n  value_column = \"GDP\",\n  number_rows = 10,\n  plot_title = \"Top 10 countries by GDP, 2020\",\n  xaxis_label = \"GDP (US$)\",\n  hover_label = \"GDP\",\n  min_label_width = 0.018,\n  color_bar_color = \"#00aced\",\n  label_color = \"white\")\nplotly::config(p, displayModeBar = FALSE)\n\n\nRead this Vignettes and the user guide to learn more about the package.\n\nThe output packed bar:\n\n\nWarning: `line.width` does not currently support multiple values.\n\nWarning: `line.width` does not currently support multiple values."

    "text": "Visualising Uncertainty\n\nWhy it is important?\n\n\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of data visualization is the visualization of uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Chart 61, LABOUR FORCE IN SINGAPORE 2019, pg. 52.\n\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of visual analytics is the visualisation of uncertainty. When we see data point drawn in a specific location, we tend to interpret it as a precise representation of the true value. It is difficult to conceive that a data point could actually lie somewhere it hasn’t been drawn. Yet this scenario is ubiquitous in data visualisation. Nearly every dataset we work with has some uncertainty, and whether and how we choose to represent this uncertainty can make a major difference in how accurately our audience perceives the meaning of the data.\nTwo commonly used approaches to indicate uncertainty are error bars and confidence bands. In this section, we will examine the basic concepts and design pricinples of these methods.\n\n\n\n\nWhy one shouldn’t use a bar graph, even if the data are normally distributed?\n\n\n\nIt is not appropriate to displace average values on bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure on the right is an EDA plot that I use to see in the Assignment 1 reports of ISSS602 Data Analytics Lab. Bar chart should be used to show count or frequency count and should not be used to reveal summary statistics such as mean. This is because the bar failed to show the range of observed values.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Error bar failed?\n\n\n\nEach error bar is constructed using a 95% confidence interval of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an error bar, the bar height represents the mean. Error bars represent 1 standard error. The y-axis starts at zero and ends just above the highest error bar.\nGiven that the y-axis typically starts at zero, bars often include irrelevance values as shown in the figure. zone of irrelevance.\n\n\n\n\nError bar on a dot plot\n\n\n\nEach error bar is constructed using a 95% confidence interval of the percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe error plot on dot plot is more truthful and informative alternatives to the error bar graph in previous slide. The plot reveals the value range of each race clearly. By applying inking principle in the design, the error plot and the mean value of each race is shown clearly.\n\n\n\n\nGraphical methods for visualising uncertainty\n\n\nReference: Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates\n\n\nThis figure shows different different alternative design of error plots: + graded error plots with caps; + graded error plots without caps; + single-interval error plots with caps; + single-interval error plots without caps; + confidence strips; and + confidence distributions.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to all these choices. You are encouraged to explore them one by one and select the best data visualisation that meet you storytelling need.\n\n\n\n\nBack to Statistics 101\n\nPopulation and samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen drawing many samples from a population, it is possible to obtain a few with means that greatly differ from the population.\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders]\n\n\nin order to prepare an error plot manually, it is good for us the revise some of the basic statistical concepts.\n\n\n\n\nA reminder of the standard normal distribution\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nIf the distribution of heights in the population is roughly normal (and, again, we don’t know this), your answer can be inspired by a chart in this slide, which displays the percentage of scores that lie in between a certain number of standard deviations from the mean. We see that 68.2 percent of score lie between -1 and 1 standard deviations from the mean, and just 0.1 percent of scores are above three standard deviation.\n\nIn a standard normal distribution, 95 percent of the scores lie between z-score -1.96 and 1.96 (that is, between -1.96 and 1.96 standard deviations from the mean).\nAlso in a standard normal distribution, 99 percent of the scores lie between z-scores -2.58 and 2.58 (they are between -2.58 and 2.58 standard deviations from the mean)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe standard error\n\n\nThe formulas of standard deviation and standard error\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nImagine that instead of drawing just a few samples from our population, we are able to get dozens of random samples of 40 purples each and that we calculate the mean of each of them.\nNext, imagine that we discard all scores from all samples, and that we just keep their means. Then, we draw a histogram of just these means. This imaginary histogram is called a distribution of sample means. As any other distribution, it will have a mean of its own (a mean of sample means) and a standard deviation. This standard deviation of many imaginary sample means is called the standard error of the mean.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the confidence interval of a mean\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nA confidence interval is an expression of the uncertainty around any statistic we wish to report. It is based on the standard error, and it’s usually communicated this way:\n“With a 95 percent level of confidence, we estimate that the average height of 12-year-old purples is 5.3feet +/-(margin of error here).\nTo calculate a confidence interval first, we need to decide on a confidence level. The most common one is 95% and 98%, although you could really pick any figure you wish. What we need to remember is that the greater the confidence level we choose, the greater the margin of error becomes.\nLet us begin with the confidence interval for the mean of a sample. The average height of purples in our sample was 5.3 feet, and the standard deviation was 0.5. The 5.3 score is a point estimate. Reporting it on its own isn’t correct. We must also disclose the uncertainty that surrounds it. The formulas for the confidence interval of the mean of a large sample and to apply them are in the slide. The z in red is called the critical value.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the confidence interval of a percentage\n\n\nReference: Cairo, A. (2016) The Truthful Art, Chapter 11, New Riders.\n\n\nThis slide shows the formulas to calculate the confidence interval of a percentage. Notice that the main different in these formula.\n\n\n\n\n2-d graphical methods for visualising uncertainty\n\n\n\nScatter plot with 95% confidence ellipse\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot with 95% confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart on the left shows the 95% confidence ellipse of a scatter plot and the chart on the right shows the 95% confidence band of a trend line (also known as best fit line).\nIt is a common mistake to think that 95% confidence ellipse contains 95% of the data. A 95% confidence ellipse for it’s mean is really an algorithm with the following property: if you were to replicate our sampling from the underlying distribution many times and each time calculate a confidence ellipse, then 95% of the ellipses so constructed would contain the underlying mean. (Note that each sample would of course yield a different ellipse.)\n\n\n\n\nConfidence band of a trend line\n\n\n\nConfidence band and fit lines\n\n\n\n\nA graded confidence band\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 95% confidence band, on the other hand, provides us with a range of different fit lines that would be compatible with the data. When student encounter a confidence band for the first time, they are often surprised that even a perfectly straight line produces a confidence band that is curved. The reason for the curvature is that the straight line fit can move in two distinct directions: it can be up and down (i.e have different intercepts), and it can rotate (i.e. having different slopes.)\nTo draw a confidence ban, we need to specify a confidence lvel, and just as we did for error plots, it can be useful to highlight different levels of confidence. This leads us to the graded confidence band, which shows several confidence levels at once."

    "text": "Variation and Its Discontents\n\nRandom and unfair comparisons\n\n\nReference: Variation and its discontents\n\n\nCentral to quantitative data analysis is an understanding of variation. When we measure multiple occurrences of things to determine how and to what extent they differ, we’re examining variation. Some variation is random and some is caused by factors that we can attempt to identify and perhaps control. Random variation consists of differences in measures that occur routinely, without a specific cause. We should note random variation and move on, because nothing can be done about it. It is noise. It tells us nothing that requires a response.\nInstances of non-random variation are signals; they tell us something useful and provide opportunities for action. Signals that indicate poor performance—an undesirable state—can perhaps be reduced by controlling the causes. Signals that indicate an especially good state of affairs can provide useful insights and opportunities for improvement.\nDespite the significance of variation, relatively few people who work with data in most organizations understand it, especially the nature of randomness. This leads to false conclusions and poor decisions, especially when comparing measures of performance within a set of like entities (e.g., countries or companies). Most organizations spend too much time examining noise: the cacophony of random variation. Learning to distinguish signals from the noise is a fundamental skill of data analysis and performance monitoring. In this article, we’ll take a look at a special version of a scatter plot, called a funnel plot (not to be confused with a funnel chart), which is designed to filter out the noise and shine a spotlight on meaningful variation when we compare performance among entities in a group. Funnel plots address the fact that entities with relatively few occurrences of the thing being measured (a small sample), when compared to entities with many occurrences (a large sample), exhibit a greater degree of random variation, which must be taken into account when comparing them. A little later we’ll take a look at this problem and the solution that funnel plots provide in relation to healthcare data, but first let’s get more familiar with the effects of sample size on randomness.\nConsider the following display (a caterpillar plot) of actual healthcare data. Each data point represents a hospital, with 260 in total. The values are mortality rates following surgeries and the solid horizontal line represents the mean.\nThe sample sizes (number of surgeries reported by each hospital) on which this graph is based range from 7 to 3,151. For this reason it isn’t appropriate to rank the hospitals by mortality rate. The ranking suggests a relationship of relative performance that cannot be determined by the data.\nImagine that, unlike the anonymous version of the graph above, each data point is labeled with the hospital’s name. Can you hear the screams of surgeons from the hospitals with the highest mortality rates in the 4th quartile section of the chart? Can you see the puffed up egos of the surgeons who work at the hospitals with mortality rates of zero in the 1st quartile section? One of the hospitals with a zero mortality rate provided a sample of only seven surgeries.\nNote: You might realize, especially if you work with healthcare data similar to the example above, that a fair comparison of hospitals would require the data to be adjusted not just to account for varying sample sizes but also for varying levels of risk. Some surgeries are more risky than others and some patients, due to varying levels of illness, are more at risk than others. We’ll ignore this for now to keep the example simple.\n\n\n\n\nFunnel plots to the rescue\n\n\n\n\nStatistical details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis funnel plot displays one data point per hospital, each of which shows the number of surgeries and the square root transformed mortality rate. The square roots of the mortality rates are not particularly meaningful in and of themselves, but that doesn’t matter because we’re simply trying to identify the hospitals that exhibit a level of performance that is outside of the boundaries of random variation and thus, according to the language of statistical process control, were probably due to a “special cause.” The farther a value falls outside of the boundaries, the more likely it is due to a special cause rather than randomness.\nNotice in the lower left-hand corner of the same plot below that two of the hospitals with mortality rates of zero reside within the boundaries, which indicates that we cannot rely on their low rates as significant.\nIt is important to note that in making this comparison, we are assuming that the hospitals are homogeneous, all part of a single system which might not true in real world. For example, surgeries of many types are being compared without taking into account the fact that surgeries vary significantly in mortality risk. Likewise, patients of various levels of heath are being compared without taking into account that some of them went into surgery much healthier than others and were therefore at lesser mortality risk.\nIt is routine when dealing with heterogeneous entities such as different types of surgeries and patients of varying levels of health to adjust values to account for these factors. In a case such as post-surgical mortality, typically an expected number of deaths is calculated to account for varying levels of risk and then the observed (actual) number of deaths that occurred is compared to this, resulting in an observed vs. expected (O/E) ratio. For a completely fair comparison of post-surgical mortality among these hospitals, it is this O/E ratio that should appear in the funnel plot.\n\n\n\nNormality assumption\n\n\n\nBefore plotting the graph, it is important to check if the values are conformed to normal distribution assumption.\nIf the raw values are not conformed to normality assumption, they have to be transformed."

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as\n\n\n\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n\nHow to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.

    "text": "Correlation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R.

In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\nScaling method\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\n\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising method\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentising method\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))"

    "text": "5.4 Seriation\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")"

    "text": "Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package.\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, the GGally, parcoords, parallelPlot and tidyverse packages will be used.\nThe code chunks below are used to install and load the packages in R.\n\npacman::p_load(GGally, parallelPlot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the World Happinees 2018 (http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/) data will be used.

In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday <- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times <- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt <- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n  }\n\nNote: ymd_hms() and hour() are from lubridate package and weekdays() is a base R function.\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels <- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks <- attacks %>%\n  group_by(tz) %>%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\nNote: Beside extracting the necessary data into attacks data frame, mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert wkday and hour fields into factor so they’ll be ordered when plotting\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the Calendar Heatmaps\n\ngrouped <- attacks %>% \n  count(wkday, hour) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk: - a tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields. - a new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions. - na.omit() is used to exclude missing value. - geom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles. - theme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot. - coord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1. - scale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\nBuilding Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country <- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %>%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 <- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks <- attacks %>%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %>%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"

This is followed by a review of selected inspiring data visualisation for revealing time series patterns. In section three, we will examine different time-series patterns graphically. In section 4, I will introduce selected not so commonly used time-series data visualisation techniques. Lastly, in section 5, we will examine how interactivity and animation can be used to enhance visual time-series data discovery."

In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday <- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times <- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt <- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n  }\n\nNote: ymd_hms() and hour() are from lubridate package and weekdays() is a base R function.\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels <- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks <- attacks %>%\n  group_by(tz) %>%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\nNote: Beside extracting the necessary data into attacks data frame, mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert wkday and hour fields into factor so they’ll be ordered when plotting\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the Calendar Heatmaps\n\ngrouped <- attacks %>% \n  count(wkday, hour) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk: - a tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields. - a new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions. - na.omit() is used to exclude missing value. - geom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles. - theme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot. - coord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1. - scale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\nBuilding Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country <- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %>%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 <- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks <- attacks %>%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %>%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"
