# The Task

[Age-sex pyramid](https://isss608-ay2022-23jan.netlify.app/outline/lesson01_outline#age-sex-pyramid) is an analytical visualisation commonly used by demographers to reveal the structure of population by gender and age group.  In this take-home exercise, you are required to reveal the demographic structure of Singapore at planning area level by using age-sex pyramid method.  Instead of plotting a single age-sex pyramid, however, you are required to display nine selected planning areas on a single view by using [trellis display (also know as small-multiple plot)](https://isss608-ay2022-23jan.netlify.app/outline/lesson01_outline#trellis-display).

# The Designing Tool

For the purpose of this take-home exercise, Tableau desktop should be used to design the analytical visualisation.

# The Data

*Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022* should be used to prepare the analytical visualisation.  It is available at [Department of Statistics, Singapore](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/)(in short SingStat). 

# The Write-up

The write-up of the take-home exercise should include but not limited to the followings:

-   A reproducible description of the procedures used to prepare the analytical visualisation.  Please refer to the senior submission I shared for example [1](https://bilian-mitb2021.netlify.app/th_ex/dataviz2/dataviz2#step-by-step-description) and [2](https://isss608visualanalyticssun.netlify.app/dataviz/dataviz1/dataviz1#step-by-step-preparation).

-   A write-up of not more than 500 words to discuss the patterns reveal by the analytical visualisation prepared.  

# Submission Instructions

This is an individual assignment. You are required to work on the take-home exercises and prepare submission individually.

The specific submission instructions are as follows:

-   The analytical visualisation must be prepared by using **Tableau Desktop**. The final workbook must be uploaded onto [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/).
-   The write-up of the take-home exercise must be in **Quarto html document** format. You are required to publish the write-up on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/).
-   Provide the links to the Take-home Exercise write-up, github repository and Tableau Public onto eLearn (i.e. Take-home Exercise section) 

# Submission date

Your completed take-home exercise is due on **22nd January 2023, by 11:59pm evening**.
