## Overview

In this hands-on exercise

## Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates

- A point estimate is a single number, such as a mean.
- Uncertainty is expressed as standard error, confidence interval, or credible interval
- Important:
    - Don't confuse the uncertainty of a point estimate with the variation in the sample

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, plotly, crosstalk, DT, ggdist, gganimate)
```

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods

The code chunk below performs the followings:

- group the observation by RACE, 
- computes the count of observations, mean, standard deviation and standard error of Maths by RACE, and
- save the output as a tibble data table called `my_sum`.

```{r}
my_sum <- exam %>%
  group_by(RACE) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n(),
    mean=mean(MATHS),
    sd=sd(MATHS)
    ) %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n-1))
```

Note: For the mathematical explanation, please refer to Slide 20 of Lesson 4. 

Next, the code chunk below will 

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(my_sum), format = 'html')

```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: ggplot2 methods

The code chunk below is used to reveal the standard error of mean maths score by race.

```{r}
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=RACE, 
        ymin=mean-se, 
        ymax=mean+se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("Standard error of mean 
          maths score by rac")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggplot2** methods

::: {.callout-note}
### Your turn 
Plot the 95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race.  The error bars should be sorted by the average maths scores. 
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
ggplot(my_sum) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), 
        ymin=mean-1.96*se, 
        ymax=mean+1.96*se), 
    width=0.2, 
    colour="black", 
    alpha=0.9, 
    size=0.5) +
  geom_point(aes
           (x=RACE, 
            y=mean), 
           stat="identity", 
           color="red",
           size = 1.5,
           alpha=1) +
  ggtitle("95% confidence interval of mean maths score by race")
```


### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates with interactive error bars

::: {.callout-note}
### Your turn
Plot interactive error bars for the 99% confidence interval of mean maths score by race.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
shared_df = SharedData$new(my_sum)

bscols(widths = c(4,8),

ggplotly((ggplot(shared_df) +
            geom_errorbar(aes(x=reorder(RACE, -mean), ymin=mean-2.58*se, ymax=mean+2.58*se), width=0.2, colour="black", alpha=0.9, size=0.5) +
            geom_point(aes (x=RACE, y=mean, text = paste("Race:", `RACE`,"<br>N:", `n`,"<br>Avg. Scores:", round(mean, digits = 2),"<br>95% CI:[", round((mean-2.58*se), digits = 2), ",", round((mean+2.58*se), digits = 2),"]")), stat="identity", color="red", size = 1.5, alpha=1) + xlab("Race") + ylab("Average Scores") + theme_minimal() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + ggtitle("99% Confidence interval of average /<br>maths scores by race")), tooltip = "text"), DT::datatable(shared_df, rownames = FALSE, class="compact", width="100%", options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), colnames = c("No. of pupils", "Avg Scores","Std Dev","Std Error")) %>%
  formatRound(columns=c('mean', 'sd', 'se'), digits=2) 
)

```  

## Visualising Uncertainty: **ggdist** package 
- [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/index.html) is an R package that provides a flexible set of ggplot2 geoms and stats designed especially for visualising distributions and uncertainty. 
- It is designed for both frequentist and Bayesian uncertainty visualization, taking the view that uncertainty visualization can be unified through the perspective of distribution visualization: 
    - for frequentist models, one visualises confidence distributions or bootstrap distributions (see vignette("freq-uncertainty-vis")); 
    - for Bayesian models, one visualises probability distributions (see the tidybayes package, which builds on top of ggdist).

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggdist** methods

In the code chunk below, [`stat_pointinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_pointinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval() +   #<<
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

Gentle advice: This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(.width = 0.95,
  .point = median,
  .interval = qi) +
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggdist** methods

::: {.callout-note}
### Your turn 
Makeover the plot on previous slide by showing 95% and 99% confidence intervals. 
:::

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_pointinterval(
    show.legend = FALSE) +   
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Mean Point + Multiple-interval plot")
```

### Visualizing the uncertainty of point estimates: **ggdist** methods

In the code chunk below, [`stat_gradientinterval()`](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/stat_gradientinterval.html) of **ggdist** is used to build a visual for displaying distribution of maths scores by race.

```{r}
exam %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = RACE, 
             y = MATHS)) +
  stat_gradientinterval(   
    fill = "skyblue",      
    show.legend = TRUE     
  ) +                        
  labs(
    title = "Visualising confidence intervals of mean math score",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
```

Gentle advice: This function comes with many arguments, students are advised to read the syntax reference for more detail.

## Visualising Uncertainty with Hypothetical Outcome Plots (HOPs)

Step 1: Installing ungeviz package

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("wilkelab/ungeviz")
```

Note: You only need to perform this step once.

Step 2: Launch the application in R

```{r}
library(ungeviz)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = exam, 
       (aes(x = factor(RACE), y = MATHS))) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(
    height = 0.3, width = 0.05), 
    size = 0.4, color = "#0072B2", alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_hpline(data = sampler(25, group = RACE), height = 0.6, color = "#D55E00") +
  theme_bw() + 
  # `.draw` is a generated column indicating the sample draw
  transition_states(.draw, 1, 3)

```
